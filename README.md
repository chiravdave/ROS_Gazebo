# Introduction
Ping Pong is a <b>two-dimensional sports game</b> that simulates <b>table tennis</b>. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other. </br>

I developed this game with the motivation that it can be used to teach about <b>Game Trees</b> for the course of <b>Artificial Intelligence</b>.
